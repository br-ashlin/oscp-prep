### Introduction

Hi there, My name is Ben and I have worked as a Systems Engineer consistently for 10+ years.

It's always been my interest and intention of moving into Cyber Security, It was around 2016 I reached out to my connections on LinkedIn and asked the basic question.. What do I need to get into this Cyber? I recieved a flurry of responses, majority of which were: "Get your OSCP".

Since then I have worked in different areas of Cyber Security, Mostly within Active Directory, Azure and more across Privileged Identity Management and Governance.

In 2021, I started my journey to OSCP by becoming a member of Hack The Box, TryHackMe and HackerOne. I also began blogging on Medium when I wanted to confirm my understanding of the concepts I was working with. I love to teach and I understand that if I can't teach it, then I don't understand it enough.

For anyone intersted in my experience and areas of study prior to OSCP, I hold the following certifications: CCNA, MCSE, VCP-DCV-20, Sec+, Pentest+ & AZ-500 (Azure Security Engineer)

### Areas of Developement

I have watched and read countless videos and articles on best preparation and even experiences and through my own experiences, I have identified the following areas that I believe I need to develop further in:

1. Linux OS (I am a Windows guy but have been using Linux for 12m roughly now)
2. Programming (I have a basic understanding of various programming languages that stem from studying Java at uni combined with my experiences in using Powershell)
3. Privilege escalation in Linux and Windows.

For this I have recently enrolled into TCMs [Practical Network Penetration Tester](https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/pnpt/) learning path. I'm unsure if I'll take the exam yet but this course covers alot of the areas I have identifed above and go into great depth, I would recommend this highly.

### Plan

I have a combined study plan amongst HackTheBox, HackerOne, TryHackMe, PortSwigger

#### Hack The box

Below are the pages of the machines completed and also highlighted as ['like OSCP machines updated for '21'](https://twitter.com/TJ\_Null/status/1328380512960995331)

#### HackerOne

For experience in Web Applications, I completed 13/26 rooms in the Hackerone CTF program.

#### TryHackMe

I began undertaking the THM Offensive path, I am also aware of the Web & Foundations Path.

#### Port Swigger Academy

I often reference and do labs in PortSwigger to gain a better understanding of XSS, SQLi and other forms of Web application vulnerabilities and exploits.
