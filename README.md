## Introduction

Hi there, My name is Ben and I have worked as a Systems Engineer consistently for 10+ years.

It's always been my interest and intention of moving into Cyber Security, It was around 2016 I reached out to my connections on LinkedIn and asked the basic question.. What do I need to get into this Cyber? I recieved a flurry of responses, majority of which were: "Get your OSCP".&#x20;

Since then I have worked in different areas of Cyber Security, Mostly within Active Directory, Azure and more across Privileged Identity Management and Governance.

In 2021, I started my journey to OSCP by becoming a member of Hack The Box.  I have also combined my learnings with HackerOne, TryHackMe as well as completing various courses. I began doing some blogging on Medium in 2021 when I wanted to confirm my understanding of the concepts I was working with, I love to teach but I also understand that if I can't explain it or teach it then I don't understand it enough.&#x20;

Come 2022, Alot of changes in life but I am back on track to sit the OSCP exam. \
I have watched and read countless videos and articles on best preparation and even though it is a bit dated now, I have considered undertaking as much of the Active machines on HacktheBox and will attempt to undertake some of the machines listed in [https://pentestblog.in/oscp/hack-the-box-htb-oscp-like-machines-list-2022/](https://pentestblog.in/oscp/hack-the-box-htb-oscp-like-machines-list-2022/) which I believe is very close if not the same as TJNull's List of Hack The Box OSCP like machines.

Areas of Developement for me are:

1. Linux OS (I am a Windows guy but have been using Linux for 12m roughly now)
2. Programming (I recently passed my Programming topic in Uni which was Java, I have a basic understanding from this but also my experiences in using Powershell)
3. Privilege escalation in Linux and Windows.

For these areas of Development, I have recently enrolled into TCMs [Practical Network Penetration Tester](https://certifications.tcm-sec.com/pnpt/) learning path. I may take the exam, I'm unsure yet but this basically covers alot of the areas I have identifed as needing to improve.

Without further delay, I will aim to progress and complete as many boxes as I can but schedule the OSCP exam between May and June this year.

Below is a list of the machines highlighted as 'like OSCP machines', these are mainly all retired now so for any that are still active I will complete and closer to exam time I will sign up HTB's VIP to complete some of the retired machines.
